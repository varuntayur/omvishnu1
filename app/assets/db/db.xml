            <explanation>For the eradication of all obstructions, I meditate ("dhyayeth") on Vishnu,
                who is wearing ("dharam") a white ("shukla") cloth ("ambara"), who is of the color
                ("varnam") of the moon ("sashi"), who has four ("chatur") arms ("bhujam"), and who
                has a placid expression ("prasanna") on His face ("vadanam").
